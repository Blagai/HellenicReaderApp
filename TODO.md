# Improvements:

* Back button in reader should move the user to text selection instead of last tab (system back should move to previous text or to text select, unless user opened from homeStart or homeContinue button, in which case it should move to the home tab)
* Title of lastRead should be the title of the story and not the file name
* Make the UI not ugly
* Design a logo


# Bugs:

* Tabs highlight not updating when moving tabs in any way that is not pressing a different tab
* Fix next button not working when selecting texts manually
* Continue button disappears when reopening the app


# Base Functionality:

* Word translation functionality (kill me)
* Translate the texts myself so that I would own the copyright and be allowed to make it public domain (kill me x2)
* Word/Whole text saving functionality
* Save certain parts of AppState even when user reopens the app - leave for later because complicated


# Texts to add:

* All Homeric Hymns
* Illiad and Oddysey
* Aristotle works
* Epictetus works
* Euripides works
* The Histories
* Hippocrates works
* Diogenes works
