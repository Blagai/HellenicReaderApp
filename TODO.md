# Improvements:
* Back button in reader should move the user to text selection instead of last tab (system back should move to previous text or to text select, unless user opened from homeStart or homeContinue button, in which case it should move to the home tab)
* Title of lastRead should be the title of the story and not the file name

# Bugs:
* Tabs highlight not updating when moving tabs in any way that is not pressing a different tab
* Fix next button not working when selecting texts manually
